### 📈 Bayesian Quadrature for Efficient and Accurate CVA Computation
📅 May 2025 📄[Download PDF](https://sebbhg.github.io/files/LBQAFCVAC3.pdf)
- Applies Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Bayesian Quadrature (BQ) to accelerate counterparty credit risk calculations
- Focuses on Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) under the LGM-1F model
- Combines analytical methods, Monte Carlo simulations, and Bayesian techniques for efficient valuation
- Targets interest rate derivatives like swaps, swaptions, and cancellable swaps
- Designed to meet regulatory standards (Basel III, FRTB) with reduced computational load
