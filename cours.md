## ðŸ”¶ Advanced Portfolio Theory: From Value at Risk to Mertonâ€™s Framework  
ðŸ“… March 2025 â€“ April 2025
[ðŸ“„ Download course PDF](files/advanced_portfolio_theory.pdf)

This course delves into the mathematical foundations of portfolio optimization within the multi-dimensional Black-Scholes framework. It focuses on utility-based approaches to asset allocation, exploring both complete and incomplete markets.

**Key topics covered:**
- Modeling wealth dynamics and gains processes in continuous time  
- Self-financing portfolios and discounted assets  
- Utility maximization using stochastic control  
- Convex duality and optimal terminal wealth  
- Hedging via stochastic integrals under risk-neutral measure  
- The Mutual Fund Theorem and its role in optimal allocation

The goal is to understand how investors can optimize their portfolios by maximizing expected utility under various constraints and market structures.

## ðŸ”· Introduction to Stochastic Processes and ItÃ´ Calculus  
ðŸ“… January 2025 â€“ March 2025
[ðŸ“„ Download course PDF](files/stochastic_processes_ito_calculus.pdf)

This course provides a deep dive into stochastic processes, ItÃ´ calculus, and their applications in finance, physics, and engineering.

**Content highlights:**
- Probability foundations and random processes  
- Markov chains, Brownian motion, and Poisson processes  
- Stochastic differential equations (SDEs)  
- ItÃ´â€™s Lemma and stochastic integration  
- Applications in derivative pricing and physical modeling

This self-authored report was written for advanced students and aims to build both theoretical rigor and practical modeling intuition.
